# Hi! You found my personal tech toolbox.

This page collects **tools, tips, resources, and code snippets** that I
frequently use for programming and academic research under Linux. My workflow
typically revolves around the command line, Emacs, Python, and LaTeX, so that's
what most of this site will be about. It's intended both as a reference for
myself and as a pointer for friends & colleagues.

Feel free to pick out a piece of information that's useful to you, and leave the rest.


## My general setup

I'm using [**Fedora Linux** with the KDE Plasma
Desktop](https://spins.fedoraproject.org/kde/), which I am very happy with after
hopping between many different Linux distros over the years. I particularly
appreciate its fast release cycleâ€”on Ubuntu, I've often cursed their package
repos for being several versions behind what I needed.

If you're not a Linux user, you might still be able to profit from some of
what's in here; I just can't give you any specific tips for your OS!


## Who made this page, anyway?

I'm [Marcel Bollmann](https://marcel.bollmann.me/), currently an associate
professor in natural language processing in Sweden. I like building
[software](https://github.com/mbollmann), [websites](https://aclanthology.org/),
and [board game castles](https://geekgroup.app/users/amaroid/).

I also keep [a repository with my Linux settings, packages,
etc.](https://github.com/mbollmann/linux-essentials/) that contains a bunch of
what I describe here on this site.
