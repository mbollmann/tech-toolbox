## fish (Shell)

The default shell on most Linux systems is the [Bash
shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)), and you can't go wrong
with learning how to use it. However, I made the switch to
[**fish**](https://fishshell.com/) a couple of years ago and now I never want to
use anything else.

What's nice about the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) is that it offers autosuggestions, tab completions, syntax highlighting, and is easy to customize and write scripts for.
{: .callout .callout-primary }

Fish can suggest completions for executables, paths, options, and even full
command invocations from your history.  Press tab to easily accept these
completions.  Syntax highlighting will furthermore tell you if a command exists
& is executable, if a given file path is valid, or if you forgot the closing
quotes on a string, _all before you ever press "Enter"._

There's one potential downside, which is that fish is not POSIX-compatible,
meaning that if you're used to Bash syntax, you might have to relearn a few
things.  In practice, I've never found this to be a huge issue.  Some common
differences that I quickly got used to are:

1. Slightly different keywords for loops and conditions:
   - <span class="d-inline-block" style="min-width:2.8em;">fish:</span><code class="highlight language-fish" data-lang="fish"><span class="k">for</span> f <span class="k">in</span> <span class="k">*</span>.pdf<span class="p">;</span> pdfinfo <span class="nv">$f</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">end</span></code>
   - <span class="d-inline-block" style="min-width:2.8em;">bash:</span><code class="highlight language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="k">for </span>f <span class="k">in</span> <span class="k">*</span>.pdf<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do </span>pdfinfo <span class="nv">$f</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">done</span></code>
2. Command substitutions without a dollar sign:
   - <span class="d-inline-block" style="min-width:2.8em;">fish:</span><code class="highlight language-fish" data-lang="fish"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="si">(</span>somecommand<span class="si">)</span></code>
   - <span class="d-inline-block" style="min-width:2.8em;">bash:</span><code class="highlight language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="si">$(</span>somecommand<span class="si">)</span></code>
3. Declaring variables:
   - <span class="d-inline-block" style="min-width:2.8em;">fish:</span><code class="highlight language-fish" data-lang="fish"><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">foo</span> <span class="s2">"bar"</span></code>
   - <span class="d-inline-block" style="min-width:2.8em;">bash:</span><code class="highlight language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">foo</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"bar"</span></code>

The fish documentation has [a comprehensive overview of the differences to Bash
syntax](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/fish_for_bash_users.html), but also,
remember that even if you set fish as your default shell, Bash is still there
for youâ€”you can still write & run Bash scripts if that's what you're more
comfortable with for a given task.  The syntactic differences are mostly
relevant for writing quick one-liners directly on the command line.

## fzf (Shell extension)

[**fzf** ("fuzzy finder")](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is a command-line
tool for finding things, but also works as an [awesome fish
extension](https://github.com/jethrokuan/fzf).  It also [comes with built-in
support for bash and
zsh](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#fuzzy-completion-for-bash-and-zsh), though
I haven't tried that.

Want to `cd` into some deeply nested directory like
`~/Documents/Courses/Intro_to_programming_2021/assignments/week3/`?  That's a
lot of keys to press, even with the help of tab completions.  How about just
typing `<Alt-C> week3 <Enter>`?

![Quickly cd-ing into a deeply nested directory with fzf](../images/fzf-altc.gif)

What was that long one-liner you used a few months ago, of which you remember
nothing except that one of its arguments was a file named `plot.pdf`?  How about
just typing `<Ctrl-R> plot.pdf` and seeing what comes up?  Of course, you could
also `grep` through your history file, but with fzf's `<Ctrl-R>` you get fuzzy,
interactive search, and if you find the command you were looking for, pressing
`<Enter>` on it will paste it directly onto your command line.

## Starship (Prompt)

I used to add a lot of customizations to my shell prompt, but
[**Starship**](https://starship.rs/) has made the process a whole lot quicker
and more enjoyable. It also works on top of _any shell._ By default, it will
give you a two-line prompt that includes information about Git branches and
states, as well as version information of any programming languages relevant for
your current directory.

You can [configure its appearance in detail](https://starship.rs/config/)
(including a more compact one-line format, if that's what you prefer), which I
have of course [done quite extensively
myself](https://github.com/mbollmann/linux-essentials/blob/master/dot-files/.config/starship.toml),
so my own prompt looks like this nowadays:

The only prerequisite for using Starship is that you configure your terminal
application to use a [Nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), which are
essentially just fancy extensions for many popular monospace fonts, adding
glyphs from many popular icon fonts. I use
[Hack](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#hack) at the moment, but you have a lot
of great choices here.
