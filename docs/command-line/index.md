# Working on the Command Line

Under Linux, I always want to have a shell at my fingertips, and I'm using it quite
heavily for all kinds of things. This section contains tips and tools to make
working on the command line even more convenient.

**If you're completely new to the command line,** or maybe Linux in general,
these resources might be a good start:

+ [Survival guide for Unix newbies](https://matt.might.net/articles/basic-unix/)
  and [Settling into Unix](https://matt.might.net/articles/settling-into-unix/)
  by Matt Might.
+ [Getting to Know the Command
  Line](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/) by David
  Baumgold.
+ [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/), a
  full online course about proficiency with commonly used tools, including the
  command line.
+ [Data Science at the Command
  Line](https://datascienceatthecommandline.com/2e/), a book
  by Jeroen Janssens about data science with Unix tools.
