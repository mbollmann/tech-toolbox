# Working on the Command Line

Under Linux, I always want to have a shell at my fingertips, and I'm using it quite
heavily for all kinds of things. This section contains tips and tools to make
working on the command line even more convenient.

**If you're completely new to the command line,** these resources might be a
good start:

+ [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/), a
  free online class about proficiency with commonly used tools, such as the
  command line.
+ [Data Science at the Command
  Line](https://datascienceatthecommandline.com/2e/), a book
  by Jeroen Janssens about data science with Unix tools.
